"""Advisory related-signal matching for the dispatcher queue (heuristic; no trained model).

Finds PENDING ``source_signals`` that may describe the same event so a dispatcher can review them
together. Nothing here confirms a disaster, merges signals, creates incidents or dispatches teams:
callers only read. The ranking score is a sort hint, NOT a probability that two alerts are the same event.
