# ResQ — Final Demo Script (Sprint 3)

**Version:** 2.0 (replaces the Sprint 2 script) · **Owner:** Siddh (S2-15, S3-15) · **Draft from the scenario test:** Dhruv
**Environment:** Render staging backend + Vercel frontend (fallback: `docker-compose.prod.yml`, see [release-runbook.md](release-runbook.md))

The demo follows one cyclone incident from a citizen report to closure, with the ingestion, AI,
field and donation parts played by the people who built them. Every step names the screen, the API
call behind it and what the audience should see. The automated version of the same path is
`frontend/e2e/cyclone.spec.ts`; `scripts/smoke.py` checks the citizen → verify → public part after every deploy.

**Rules the demo must show, not just state**

* AI output is advisory. It never verifies, prioritises, dispatches or closes anything; a human decides and the decision is recorded.
* Only verified incidents reach the public map, with coordinates rounded to 4 decimals and no personal data.
* A field team sees only its own dispatches; another team's dispatch answers 404.
* Every state change writes a hash-chained audit row (`python -m app.cli verify-audit`).
* Simulated and sandbox data are labelled on screen (simulated incidents, fallback alerts, SANDBOX payments).

## 2. Before each run (operator checklist)

- [ ] `GET <backend>/api/v1/health` returns `{"status": "ok", "database": "ok"}` and `version` is the commit or tag being demoed. Open it 2 minutes early: the free Render instance sleeps (the ingest cron keeps it warm every 10 minutes).
- [ ] Accounts exist; each command or screen shows the TOTP secret once, so add it to the presenter's authenticator app straight away:
  - dispatcher with `DISPATCH`, `SUPERVISOR` and `CLOSURE` permissions: `python -m app.cli create-staff --email … --name … --permissions DISPATCH,SUPERVISOR,CLOSURE` (password from `RESQ_STAFF_PASSWORD` or the prompt), or **Add Disaster Management Staff** on `/dm/staff` as a supervisor;
  - two field responders on two different TEAM resources (team 1 near Ahmedabad, team 2 elsewhere): `python -m app.cli create-field --email … --name … --team "<team name or resource id>" --callsign …`;
  - the citizen registers live in step 1 (or use a prepared account if time is short).
- [ ] TOTP apps for the dispatcher and both responders are on the presenters' phones.
- [ ] Teams are `AVAILABLE` on `/dm/resources` (a team left reserved by the last rehearsal will not be recommended).
- [ ] Frontend has `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMENT_SANDBOX=true`; backend has `PAYMENT_GATEWAY=mock` and `MOCK_GATEWAY_SECRET`.
- [ ] AI: `AI_TRIAGE_URL` points at the `drch-ai-triage` service (`/triage`) and `AI_TRIAGE_TOKEN` matches on both services. `AI_IMAGE_SERVICE_URL` is set only if the image service is deployed (step 7c otherwise shows the "unavailable" path).
- [ ] Browser tabs: `/` (public map), `/report`, `/my-reports`, `/dm`, `/field` (phone width, second browser profile for team 2), `/donate`.

## 3. Walkthrough

### Step 1 — Citizen signs up (Zalak)
* **Screen:** `/signup` · **API:** `POST /api/v1/auth/register`
* Show the password rules (a weak password is refused with 422), then register.
* **Expect:** account created and signed in (session cookie only; no token in `localStorage`).

### Step 2 — Out-of-state report is refused (Zalak)
* **Screen:** `/report` · **API:** `POST /api/v1/incidents` with an `Idempotency-Key`
* Drop the pin in Jaipur (26.9124, 75.7873).
* **Expect:** `422 OUTSIDE_GUJARAT`; nothing is stored.

### Step 3 — Valid cyclone report (Zalak)
* **Screen:** `/report`, then `/my-reports`
* Scenario **Cyclone**, Ahmedabad pin, urgency High, people affected 15, description of trapped residents.
* **Expect:** `201` with an `INC-YYYY-NNNNNN` reference; `/my-reports` shows status **SUBMITTED** (refreshes every 15 s). A retry with the same idempotency key returns the same incident, not a second one.

### Step 4 — Not public yet (Tanishq narrates)
* **Screen:** `/` public map · **API:** `GET /api/v1/public/incidents`
* **Expect:** the new reference is **absent**. Unverified reports never reach the public map.

### Step 5 — Signals from outside sources (Rudra)
* **Screen:** `/dm/ingestion` (source health, "Poll now" = `POST /api/v1/dm/ingestion/poll`), then `/dm/signals`
* Show the USGS / SACHET alerts and replayed social posts in the queue, each with its source and AI pre-label marked as a suggestion. Say out loud that the social posts are a replay fixture (section 6).
* Promote one signal (`POST /api/v1/dm/signals/{id}/promote`) and dismiss another with a rationale.
* **Expect:** the promoted signal becomes a **SUBMITTED** incident (still not public); dismissal needs a reason.

### Step 6 — Dispatcher signs in with MFA (Tanishq)
* **Screen:** `/login` · **API:** `POST /api/v1/auth/login` → `{"mfa_required": true, "mfa_token": …}` → `POST /api/v1/auth/mfa/verify`
* **Expect:** the DM workspace opens only after the TOTP code.

### Step 7 — AI advisory, and what happens when it is down
**7a. Triage (Neeti).** Open the citizen incident (`/dm/incidents/{id}`), press **Run AI triage** (`POST /api/v1/dm/incidents/{id}/ai-triage`).
* **Expect:** a suggestion labelled "AI suggestion, not verified" with scenario, priority, confidence and factors, or **LOW_CONFIDENCE** below the threshold. The incident's status and priority have **not** changed.
* Record the human decision: Accept, Modify or Reject with a rationale (`POST /api/v1/dm/incidents/{id}/ai-recommendations/{rec_id}/decision`, `action` = `ACCEPTED` / `MODIFIED` / `REJECTED`). Nothing changes on the incident unless the dispatcher explicitly applies it. A second decision on the same recommendation is refused (409).

**7b. AI down (Dhruvil).** With the triage service stopped (or `AI_TRIAGE_URL` unset on a spare environment), run triage again.
* **Expect:** `503 AI_UNAVAILABLE`, recorded as UNAVAILABLE; the dispatcher carries on manually. The rest of the console keeps working.

**7c. Photo analysis (Dhruvil, optional).** Upload a JPEG/PNG/WebP on the incident (`POST /api/v1/dm/incidents/{id}/photo-analyse`).
* **Expect:** an advisory label with confidence, never stored as verification. Without `AI_IMAGE_SERVICE_URL`: `503 AI_PHOTO_UNAVAILABLE` and a clear message.

### Step 8 — Verify, then see recommendations (Tanishq, Nisarg explains)
* Verify the incident with priority **High** and a rationale (`POST /api/v1/dm/incidents/{id}/verification`, `decision: VERIFIED`, current `version`).
* Show the public map (`/`): the incident now appears, coordinates rounded to 4 decimals, no reporter data.
* Open **Create dispatch**: the panel lists recommended teams (`GET /api/v1/dm/incidents/{id}/team-recommendations`) with distance, matched and supporting capabilities and the reason; the label says it needs dispatcher confirmation.
* **Expect:** recommendations never create a dispatch. Nisarg explains the ranking (capability groups first, then distance).

### Step 9 — Dispatcher assigns team 1 (Tanishq)
* Choose the receiving agency, team 1 and instructions; submit (`POST /api/v1/dm/incidents/{id}/dispatches` with an `Idempotency-Key`).
* **Expect:** dispatch `DISP-YYYY-NNNNNN` in **REQUESTED**; team 1 is reserved and disappears from the recommendations (no double booking). A double click does not create a second dispatch.

### Step 10 — Field team 1 works the assignment (Janvi, phone width)
* **Screen:** `/field` (signed in with MFA; assignments refresh every 15 s)
* Acknowledge → **ACKNOWLEDGED**; progress **EN_ROUTE** with a note → dispatch **DISPATCHED** and the incident **DISPATCHED**; then **ON_SCENE**.
* Request backup: capability `boat`, note "water rising in the lane" (`POST /api/v1/field/dispatches/{id}/team-requests`).
* **Expect:** each step appears on the dispatcher's dispatch timeline; progress before acknowledgement is refused (409).

### Step 11 — Another team cannot see it (Nisarg as team 2)
* Team 2's `/field` does not list the dispatch. Calling team 1's dispatch id directly (for example `POST /api/v1/field/dispatches/{id}/acknowledgement`) answers **404**, not 403, so ids cannot be probed.

### Step 12 — Backup request decision (Tanishq)
* **Screen:** `/dm/team-requests` · **API:** `POST /api/v1/dm/team-requests/{id}/decision`
* Approve with a rationale.
* **Expect:** status **APPROVED** and a **pre-filled dispatch draft** (suggested team with the boat capability). No dispatch is created until the dispatcher submits it. Declining requires a rationale.

### Step 13 — Field completion does not close the incident (Janvi → Tanishq)
* Janvi completes the dispatch with a summary (`POST /api/v1/field/dispatches/{id}/completion`).
* **Expect:** dispatch **COMPLETED**, team released; the incident stays open and the dispatcher is prompted to confirm resolution.

### Step 14 — Resolution and closure (Tanishq)
* Resolve (`POST /api/v1/dm/incidents/{id}/resolution`). Resolution is refused while a dispatch is still active (`409 OPEN_DEPENDENCIES`).
* Close with a reason and a public summary (`POST /api/v1/dm/incidents/{id}/closure`, needs the `CLOSURE` permission).
* **Expect:** **CLOSED**; the incident leaves the public map (it lists VERIFIED, DISPATCHED and RESOLVED incidents only); every step is in the audit trail.

### Step 15 — The citizen sees the outcome (Zalak)
* `/my-reports`: timeline SUBMITTED → VERIFIED → DISPATCHED → RESOLVED → CLOSED, and any information request the dispatcher sent (the citizen can answer it in the same view).

### Step 16 — Sandbox donation (Shlok)
* **Screen:** `/donate` (SANDBOX banner visible) · **API:** `POST /api/v1/donations` (`Idempotency-Key`) → `POST /api/v1/donations/{id}/sandbox-payment` → `POST /api/v1/donations/{id}/verify`
* **Expect:** a receipt `REC-YYYY-NNNNNN` only after the server checks the signature; repeating the verification returns the same receipt.
* Show the ending screens with the sandbox preview buttons: **Preview Decline**, **Preview Timeout** and **Cancel & Abandon Order**. They are labelled "SANDBOX PREVIEW — nothing was sent to the gateway"; the server is not told about these endings yet (see section 5).

### Closing (Siddh)
* Run `python -m app.cli verify-audit` (or show its last CI result): the hash chain is intact.
* One slide: what is real and what is simulated (section 6).

## 4. If something goes wrong on stage

| Problem | What the operator does |
|---|---|
| Backend cold (first request slow or 502) | Wait for `/api/v1/health`; narrate step 4 meanwhile. Next time open health 2 minutes early. |
| AI triage times out | That is step 7b: show the 503 path and continue manually. |
| Image service not deployed | Skip 7c or show the 503 message. |
| A team is still reserved from the last run | Complete, reject or fail the leftover dispatch on `/dm/dispatches` (that releases the team), then note it in the rehearsal log. |
| TOTP rejected | Check the phone clock; a code is valid for one 30 s window. |
| Staging unusable | Switch to the compose fallback on the demo laptop (release-runbook section 1). |

## 5. Known gaps on 11 Nov 2026 (do not click into these)

| Gap | Owner | Demo workaround |
|---|---|---|
| Gateway webhook (`POST /api/v1/payments/webhook/{gateway}`), `GET /api/v1/me/donations` and server-side cancel/expiry are in Shlok's open S2-12 / S3-11 work, not on `main` | Shlok | Show the receipt on the confirmation screen; use the preview buttons for the endings. |
| `/triage` uses the rules baseline; the trained text model (S2-05) and `InProcessProvider` (S2-06) are pending the frozen dataset (S1-10) | Neeti, Dhruvil | Present triage as the rules baseline with guardrails. |
| LLM adapter (S2-08) not built; `LLM_ENABLED` stays off | Zalak | Do not mention an LLM step. |
| Duplicate grouping uses the rules method (`"method": "rules"`) until S2-07 | Dhruvil, Zalak | Show the candidate list and the human link/merge/dismiss decision only. |

---

## 6. Real vs simulated (say it out loud)

| Part | Status |
|---|---|
| Accounts, MFA, RBAC, audit chain, geofence, dispatch locking, field isolation | Real |
| USGS and SACHET alerts | Real feeds; fallback alerts are labelled `is_fallback` |
| Social posts | Replayed fixture (`social_replay.jsonl`), labelled as replay |
| Demo incidents from the seed | `is_simulated = TRUE`, hidden from the public map outside development |
| AI triage | Rules baseline, advisory only |
| Payments | Sandbox mock gateway; no real money |

---

## 7. Rehearsal log (S3-15)

| Run | Date | Duration | Steps that failed | Defects raised (P0 / P1 / P2) | Fixed before next run? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Rehearsal 1 | | | | | |
| Rehearsal 2 | | | | | |
| Final demo | | | | | |

Dhruv records each defect in the S3-17 list; Siddh approves which P0s block the release tag.
